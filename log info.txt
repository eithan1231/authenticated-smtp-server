Just for future reference.

Each and ever log SHOULD have 'txn' parameter set. 'txn' will indicate the event
which occured. Documentation for events are listed below.

NOTE: All logs made by non-dependencies with the exception of the txn 'general'
	are prefixed with 'svr' to prevent conflicting log names.

txn 'svr-auth'
prameters:
	address - the address that was attempted to login with
	ip - the IP address that tried logging in.
	status - basically a status of the login. Possible values: ('bad-address', 'bad-password', 'okay')


txn 'svr-send'
parameters:
	success - (boolean) whether or not it was successful
	sender - Person who is sending email
	recipient - person who be receiving email
	subjcet - subject of email


txn 'general'
parameters:
	cause - why this log is occurring ('welcome', 'sigint')
	... the rest vary depending on the cause
